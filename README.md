# Germination_project
### Include all codes for image processing and data analysis for germination of Streptomyces spp.
Input data are the nd2 files from Nikon timelapes microscopy. Output data are the image files ('IMGs11.m') that track germination 
process of each spore(or spore clusters if not correctly separated by the script) and the analysis results (e.g.'results11.m).
